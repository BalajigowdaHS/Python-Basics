##You have a football field that is 92 meter long and 48.8 meter wide. Find out total area using python and print it.
length=92
width=48.8
area=length*width
print("Area of the football field is", area)


##You bought 9 packets of potato chips from a store. Each packet costs 1.49 dollar and you gave shopkeeper 20 dollar.
# Find out using python, how many dollars is the shopkeeper going to give you back?

number_of_packets = 9
cost_of_each_packets= 1.49
Total_cost=number_of_packets*cost_of_each_packets
returned_change = 20-Total_cost
print("The returned change is",returned_change)

##You want to replace tiles in your bathroom which is exactly square and 5.5 feet is its length.
# If tiles cost 500 rs per square feet, how much will be the total cost to replace all tiles.
# Calculate and print the cost using python (Hint: Use power operator ** to find area of a square)

length = 5.5
cost = 500
total_area = 5.5**2
total_cost = total_area*cost
print("The cost to replace all tiles is", total_cost)
