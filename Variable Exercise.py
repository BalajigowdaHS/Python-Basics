##Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

birth_year = 2000
current_year = 2022
current_age = current_year - birth_year
print("current age is ", current_age)

##Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables

F_name = 'Balaji'
M_name = 'gowda'
L_name = ' H S'
print("Full name is", F_name+M_name+L_name)
